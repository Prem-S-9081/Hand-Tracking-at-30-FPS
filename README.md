# Hand Tracking at 30 FPS
This is handtracking application with basic features to analize the motion or movement of the object 

To work on this code some of the library tools are used and they are mentioned below:          
     1. CV2 which is used to capture the media.       
     2. Mediapipe - it is a library file present in the python which is used for the purpose of tracking.       
     3. Tkinter library is also used for front and frame work of the project.  
     
It analizes to track the motion and movements of the hand and gives the output in the form of coordinates  of X axis and Y axis.  
It uses 30 FPS ( Frames Per Second ) to analyze the action or movement of the object.  

NOTE: If the code should be converted into software the auto-py-to-exe library should be used.
